## **BCG Data Science Analytics Virtual Experience Program**

### **Background**
Your client, **PowerCo**, is a major gas and electricity utility company serving corporate, SME (small and medium enterprise), and residential customers. Following the power liberalization of the energy market in Europe, they have experienced significant churn, particularly in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to diagnose and address the causes of churn within this customer group.

The hypothesis is that **price changes** significantly affect customer churn. To test this, a predictive model could help identify which customers are at risk of churning due to price sensitivity. Additionally, offering a **20% discount** to at-risk customers could serve as an effective retention strategy, particularly for those who view price as the main concern.

### **Task 1: Business Understanding and Hypothesis Testing**
Your first task is to understand the situation with the client and devise an approach to test the hypothesis.

Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and outline the steps needed to test it. Focus on the data you would need from the client and the analytical models you would apply.

#### Consider the following questions:
- What are the key factors driving a customer's decision to stay with or switch providers?
- What data sources and fields could help explore the contribution of various factors to customer churn?
- How would the data frame look? What should each column and row represent?
- What kind of exploratory analyses can provide deeper insights into churn behavior?

### **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
The project team believes building a churn model to understand the correlation between price sensitivity and churn is worthwhile. The client has provided historical data, including:

- **Historical customer data**: Usage, sign-up date, forecasted usage
- **Historical pricing data**: Fixed and variable pricing
- **Churn indicator**: Whether or not each customer has churned

For **Task 2**, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:

- Inspect the data types, statistics, and variable distributions
- Test the hypothesis that price sensitivity correlates with churn
- Summarize key findings and suggest possible data augmentations, including other data sources the client should provide and useful open-source datasets

### **Task 3: Feature Engineering and Modelling**
The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels ready to explore features that could help in building the churn model. Feature engineering is essential for unlocking predictive insights.

For **Task 3**:

- Identify potential drivers of churn based on available data and clean the dataset accordingly
- Build features that could improve the predictive power of the churn model
- Evaluate a **random forest classifier**, documenting its advantages and limitations for this use case

**Bonus**: Estimate the potential savings for the client with the use of the churn prediction model.

### **Task 4: Findings and Recommendations**
PowerCo wants an update on the project's progress. For **Task 4**, prepare a concise abstract slide summarizing the findings.

When preparing this slide, consider:
- The most important metric or number to present to the client
- The level of technical detail necessary for the audience
- The impact the model could have on the clientâ€™s bottom line
